# The e+e- to mu+mu- cross section calculation
This tutorial, implemented as a Python notebook, provides a detailed step-by-step calculation of the differential cross section of the simplest QED process.

## Dependencies
The jupyter notebook uses the free, but amazingly powerful, Python symbolic algebra module __sympy__.
